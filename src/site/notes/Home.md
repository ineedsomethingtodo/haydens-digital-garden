Hey there traveler! Welcome to my digital garden. I kinda think traditional social media sucks these days but still want somewhere I can post to and look back on in the future. This will include photos, videos, blog style posts, and WIPs. I aspire to be creative constantly, and love music and want to learn to make good music effectively and efficiently, I like to draw, and I like to write, so I will be posting all of those here and showing the progression/evolution of these projects. I will also be posting my workout progress and journey, including my stats and progress pics. I hope you like what you see!

P.S. I don't entirely know how this whole digital garden thing works and don't know how Obsidian works super well yet, so this might suck for a bit, but that's half the fun, isn't it?
